# README
## Abstract:
This application is an easy way to play tic-tac-toe. The game starts off with player one being "X" and player two as "O". The application keeps track of each players wins and the game is reset after each win or draw.

## Installation Instructions:
1. Open the github repository “tictactoe”.
2. Fork the repository.
3. On the forked repository page click on the green `<>Code` button and copy the SSH key.
4. In your own terminal go to the directory in which you wish to clone this repository to.
5. Once there type `git clone` and paste in the SSH key.
6. Next go to the directory that it is inside of and open the “index.html” in your browser, from there you should be able to use the application as intended.

## Context:
This project took approximately 42 hours to complete. The majority of the time was spent understanding class to class interactions and how it interacted with the main.js to make the application function. I'm currently in week 6 of a 6 month intense program through the Turing School of Software and Design.

## Learning Goals: 
The learning goals for this project was to build out a frontend application by implementing my knowledge and understanding of writing DRY Javascript. Also, I had to demonstrate my understanding of event delegation to handle similar event listeners. In addition I had to show my knowledge of the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM. With these learning goals I was able to improve my methods of debugging problems within my code and learning to problem solve large problems by solving it step by step. 

## Wins + Challenges:
* My biggest win and challenge was learning how to detect win conditions with each players moves. My first thought was to put the win conditions in an array within an array. This turned out to be one the hardest pieces of code I learned and had to understand. This challenge alone took approximately 1/3 of the total time spent on the project. I started to believe in my idea array when I realized I could put each players moves in a specific order using the event.target ID. This was the beginning of my biggest win I had during this project. 

* Another big challenge that I faced was learning how to create classes that interacted with the main.js. Through trial and error I was able to debug my logic by using console.logs and accessing the dev tools. Being able to see what was happening with my code allowed me to understand my functions and how they interacted with data model. The tools I learned during this challenge of debugging greatly improved as the project went on and became a huge win to help finish this project.
